# py-stats Package Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive Python statistics package called `py-stats` that provides over 40 statistical functions similar to those found on scientific calculators. The package is designed to be pure-Python with minimal dependencies and offers both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### Univariate Statistics (25+ functions)

#### Means
- ✅ **Arithmetic mean** - Standard average
- ✅ **Harmonic mean** - Reciprocal of arithmetic mean of reciprocals
- ✅ **Geometric mean** - Nth root of product of values
- ✅ **Quadratic mean** - Root mean square (RMS)

#### Central Tendency
- ✅ **Median** - Middle value
- ✅ **Mode** - Most frequent value(s)
- ✅ **Midrange** - Average of min and max
- ✅ **Trimean** - (Q1 + 2×Q2 + Q3) / 4

#### Quantiles
- ✅ **Quartiles** - Q1, Q2 (median), Q3
- ✅ **Hinges** - Lower and upper hinges
- ✅ **Quantile** - General quantile at specified probability

#### Dispersion
- ✅ **Variance** - Sample and population versions
- ✅ **Standard deviation** - Sample and population versions
- ✅ **Average deviation** - Mean absolute deviation
- ✅ **Median absolute deviation (MAD)** - Robust dispersion measure

#### Shape
- ✅ **Skewness** - Measure of distribution asymmetry
- ✅ **Kurtosis** - Measure of distribution peakedness

#### Specialized
- ✅ **Angular mean** - Mean of angular quantities
- ✅ **Running average** - Moving average with specified window
- ✅ **Weighted average** - Average with custom weights
- ✅ **Standard error of the mean** - Standard error calculation

### Multivariate Statistics (8+ functions)

#### Correlation
- ✅ **Pearson correlation** - Linear correlation coefficient
- ✅ **Q-correlation** - Robust correlation based on quantiles

#### Covariance
- ✅ **Covariance** - Sample and population versions

#### Regression
- ✅ **Linear regression** - Slope, intercept, and R-squared

#### Sums
- ✅ **Sxx** - Sum of squared deviations from mean of x
- ✅ **Syy** - Sum of squared deviations from mean of y
- ✅ **Sxy** - Sum of products of deviations

## Key Features

- Proper license and documentation
- CI/CD ready configuration

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install from PyPI (when published)
pip install py-stats
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import py_stats as ps

# Univariate analysis
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(f"Mean: {ps.arithmetic_mean(data)}")
print(f"Median: {ps.median(data)}")
print(f"Standard deviation: {ps.standard_deviation(data)}")

# Multivariate analysis
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]
print(f"Correlation: {ps.pearson_correlation(x, y)}")
```

## Testing

The package includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/test_univariate.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_multivariate.py -v
```

## Examples

The `examples/basic_usage.py` script demonstrates:
- All univariate functions with sample data
- All multivariate functions with sample data
- Real-world examples (student grades, time series)
- Error handling examples
- Advanced statistical analysis

## Dependencies

- **Core**: Python 3.7+
- **Required**: NumPy 1.19.0+ (for enhanced functionality)
- **Development**: pytest, black, flake8, mypy (optional)

## Performance Notes

- Designed for educational and research purposes
- Pure Python implementation for clarity
- For large datasets, consider NumPy/SciPy for better performance
- All functions are optimized for typical use cases

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:
